    <p>Stellenbosch (/ˈstɛlənbɒʃ/;[2] Afrikaans: [ˈstɛlənbɔs])[3][4] is a town in the Western 
        Cape province of South Africa, situated about 50 kilometres (31 miles) east of Cape 
        Town, along the banks of the Eerste River at the foot of the Stellenbosch Mountain. 
        It is the second oldest European settlement in the province, after Cape Town. The town 
        became known as the City of Oaks or Eikestad in Afrikaans and Dutch due to the large 
        number of oak trees that were planted by its founder, Simon van der Stel, to grace the 
        streets and homesteads.</p>

    <h2>The Western Cape</h2>
    <img class="img" src="wc.jpeg">
    <p>The Western Cape (Afrikaans: Wes-Kaap; Xhosa: iNtshona-Koloni) is a province of South 
        Africa, situated on the south-western coast of the country. It is the fourth largest of 
        the nine provinces with an area of 129,449 square kilometres (49,981 sq mi), and the 
        third most populous, with an estimated 6.6 million inhabitants in 2018.[4] About 
        two-thirds of these inhabitants live in the metropolitan area of Cape Town, which is 
        also the provincial capital. The Western Cape was created in 1994 from part of the former
         Cape Province.</p>

    <p>When living in Stellenbosch, it is difficult to separate the University from the town. 
        Nestled among picturesque mountains in the heart of the Cape Winelands, a large part 
        of the town’s identity can be attributed to the presence of more than 25 000 resident 
        students. This makes for a vibrant environment, alive with different cultures and 
        activities.</p>
    <p>
         Recognised as one of the top universities in South Africa, Stellenbosch University 
         takes pride in the fact that proportionally, it has one of the country’s highest numbers 
         of postgraduate students – of which almost ten percent are international students. We 
         have a significant role to play in the development of South Africa and our continent. 
         We strive to achieve this through aligning our efforts with national priorities and in 
         doing so, are helping to build the intellectual, scientific and technological capacity 
         of Africa.</p>

    <h3 id="uni">Stellenbosch University</h3>
    <img class="img" src="images (1).jpeg">

        has a rich history dating back to 1863 and has 10 faculties, including Engineering, 
        Commerce, Science and Arts. The Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering is

    <p>The Stellenbosch, Paarl and Franschhoek valleys form the Cape Winelands, the larger of the 
        two main wine growing regions in South Africa. The South African wine industry produces 
        about 1,000,000,000 litres of wine annually. Stellenbosch is the primary location for 
        viticulture and viticulture research. Professor Perold was the first Professor of 
        Viticulture at Stellenbosch University. The Stellenbosch Wine Route established in 1971 
        by Frans Malan from Simonsig, Spatz Sperling from Delheim and Neil Joubert from Spier, 
        known as Stellenbosch American Express® Wine Routes since 2002, is a world-renowned and 
        popular tourist destination. This route provides visitors the opportunity to experience 
        a wide range of cultivars and includes farms such as Warwick and JC Le Roux.[19]</p>
